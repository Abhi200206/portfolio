                    <p>During my time as an open-source contributor at GirlScript Summer of Code (GSSOC), I gained comprehensive knowledge about the open-source ecosystem and
                        the processes involved in contributing effectively. Successfully making my first pull request marked a significant milestone in my open-source journey.
                        This experience enhanced my ability to collaborate with other developers, contributing to shared projects and learning from peers. I improved my proficiency
                        with version control systems like Git, managing and submitting changes to codebases. Participating in code reviews allowed me to provide and receive feedback,
                        ensuring high-quality contributions. Actively engaging with the open-source community, I participated in discussions and contributed to project documentation.
                        I applied my technical skills in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and other technologies to real-world open-source projects, developing problem-solving skills by tackling issues and implementing solutions.
                        This experience provided exposure to a variety of projects and coding practices, broadening my understanding of software development.</p>
